# virtual-arabic-keyboard
A virtual arabic keyboard built using Angular.js and accompanying this tutorial [Building an Arabic transliteration system or virtual keyboard using Angular.js](http://www.techiediaries.com/building-an-arabic-tranliteration-system-or-virtual-keyboard-using-angularjs)

The virtual keyboard can be used in two ways :

Either via mouse in this case there is no tranliteration just simple text concatenation

Or via physical keyboard in this case we type in English so our system needs to transliterate and convert the English alphabet to Arabic and put it on the textarea for the user to copy.
